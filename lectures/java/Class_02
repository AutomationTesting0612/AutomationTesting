1. Java is a programming language and a platform.
2. Any hardware and software environment in which program runs is known as platform.

   Features of Java

1. Platform Independent :- When Java program runs, the java compiler create the bytecode(.class file). JVM execute this byte code and run the program.

    HelloWorld.java -----javac ---HelloWorld.class(bytecode)------JVM-----mac, windows, safari.

javac compiling the HelloWorld.java class and generate teh byte code. Now JVM runs this byte code in different operating system.


2. Secured :- Java provides the security using the String class.

3. Object Oriented :- Everything in java is in form of object.

4. Java is robust in nature

   Java is a robust programming language because it can efficiently handle errors and unexpected situations, which ensures reliable application execution. Here are some reasons why Java is considered robust:
   Strong memory management
   Java uses automatic garbage collection to eliminate objects that are no longer in use, which reduces the likelihood of memory leaks.
   Exception handling
   Java's exception handling framework allows developers to manage runtime errors so that the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.
   Type checking at compile-time
   Java performs strict type checking during compilation to catch errors early in the development cycle.
   Backward compatibility
   Older Java applications can run on newer versions, which allows developers to adopt new features without sacrificing compatibility.
   Secure
   Java applications are secure because of compile-time and runtime checking of source code and bytecode.
   Platform-independent
   Java is compiled to bytecode that can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


---------------------------JVM/JRE/JDK----------------------------------

JVM :- a) JVM is java virtual machine which doesn't physical exist.
b) It provides the environment in which byte code gets execute.


JRE :- JRE is Java Runtime environment which has all the libraries of java.

JDK : a) JDK is a java development kit
b) JDK = JVM + JRE

-------------------------Data Types-----------------------

There are two types of Data Types

1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non Primitive Data Types


1. Primitive Data Types :-
a) Primitive data types specify the size and type of variable values.
b) There are 8 types of Primitive data types in Java â€“ Boolean, char, byte, int, short, long, float, and double
